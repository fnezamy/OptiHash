Planning and Design
--
UI
- displays all tasks and a calendar that is processed from tasks
- organize tasks by deadlines and priorities
- how to display on UI? have user organize their own space??
- figure out key differences for Normal and Premium Users
	- less freedom with configuring generated calendars
	- cap number of generated calendars in a specific window of time (2-3 per week)
- will use React for live updates that keep a smooth UI flow for user
	- have a "board/post-it" system like trello where they can be moved around and spots should be saved
	- later on: need to make responsive

Backend
- need to set up PostgreSQL db to store tasks for each user
	- need to design a model
- node/express to create web server
	- Routes:
		- /dashboard - for all tasks and calendars in specific details
		- / index - page that displays upcoming deadlines and major tasks with high priority
		- /dashboard#modify - allow for addition/removal of new tasks. need to toggle this mode so that user doesn't accidentally delete important information
		- /login - need login page
		- /logout - need logout option to log user out of their session
