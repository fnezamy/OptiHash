This file is brainstorming thoughts about the necessary models for the OptiHash Productivity Dashboard

Models (assuming web app with many users):

- User
  - Name (Who is this person)

- Notes
  - User id (Who does this belong to)
  - Type (What is this for Task/Event/Link/etc.)
  - Tag(s) (user provided classification for organization)
  - Description (more detailed description)
  - Due date (when does this need to be addressed by)

- Reminders
  - Note id (what is this referencing)
  - Notification date-time (when should we spam the user with this reminder)

# TODO:
  - Determine how to organize the application? (is it a web app that should have many users or a single desktop app for each user)
    - Then this gets into authentication...
    - What else do we need to store?
  - What types of notes do they need to take down?
    - Currently considering links (articles), tasks (deadlines/assignments), events (calendar events)
  - How are we displaying each of these things to the user?
  - How does scheduling work exactly?
  - Sharing stuff... how do we know who has access?
